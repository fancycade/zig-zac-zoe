# Zig Zac Zoe

Writing a very basic command-line tic-tac-toe game in [Zig](https://ziglang.org) as a way of learning the very basics of the language.

Previously, I did this in [Rust](https://github.com/sts10/rusty-tac) and [Go](https://github.com/sts10/tic-tac-go) as [a learning exercise in those two languages](https://sts10.github.io/2017/11/18/trying-go-and-rust.html).

## Installing Zig
I went with the snap install (`snap install zig --classic --beta`) as listed in [Zig's GitHub wiki](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki/Install-Zig-from-a-Package-Manager). Running v0.9.1 for now.

## Running this thing

Run my program with `zig build run`. Most of the code work is in `src/main.zig`.
